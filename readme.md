# Bitlend

A Bitcoin-native DeFi platform that transforms Bitcoin into a dynamic DeFi asset.

## What It Does

Bitlend transforms Bitcoin into a dynamic DeFi asset by offering:

**Lending**: Deposit Bitcoin into diverse pools with varying risk/reward profiles to earn competitive APYs.

**Borrowing**: Use Bitcoin as collateral to borrow stablecoins (USDC, USDT, DAI) or other assets, with real-time health factor monitoring to prevent liquidations.

**Staking**: Stake Bitcoin in validator pools or governance tokens (BTLD) for rewards and voting power in protocol governance.

**Analytics**: Track portfolio performance, protocol metrics, and market trends with real-time data visualizations.

**Security**: Non-custodial architecture, audited smart contracts, and decentralized infrastructure ensure user funds remain secure.

## The Problem It Solves

Bitcoin holders often face limited options to utilize their assets without sacrificing custody or security. Traditional DeFi platforms focus on Ethereum or other blockchains, leaving Bitcoin underutilized in decentralized finance. Bitlend solves this by:

- Providing a Bitcoin-native DeFi ecosystem for lending, borrowing, and staking.
- Enabling users to earn yields or access liquidity without selling their Bitcoin.
- Offering a secure, non-custodial platform that prioritizes user control and transparency.
- Bridging Bitcoin's store-of-value strength with DeFi's yield-generating potential.

## Challenges Faced

**Bitcoin's Technical Constraints**: Bitcoin's scripting limitations made integrating DeFi functionalities challenging, requiring innovative use of Citrea's layer-2 scaling solutions.

**User Experience**: Balancing a sophisticated cyberpunk aesthetic with intuitive navigation for both DeFi novices and experts.

**Real-Time Data**: Ensuring low-latency, accurate real-time metrics (e.g., APY, TVL) across a decentralized network.

**Security**: Designing a non-custodial system robust enough to withstand attacks while maintaining user-friendliness.

**Liquidity**: Creating diverse lending pools with sufficient TVL to attract users while managing risk and reward profiles.
